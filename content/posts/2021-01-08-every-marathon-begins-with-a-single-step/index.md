> Whatever can happen at any time can happen today. — Seneca

For some time I have been looking to get back into building side projects, often starting, being interrupted, and then ultimately stopping without shipping anything.  This is a huge deviation from how productive I was some time ago, a time when within a relatively short period I had the output that was envied among my peers.  Creating my startup, Fotostat (to help photographers), Teesounds (to give audiophiles some style), building a large following on a new platform (Google+) and several other small side projects, I felt like I could churn out something relatively easily, even when already loaded up.

Once I sunsetted Fotostat, I took some time off creating, and focussed on other aspects of my life.  Took up new hobbies, experienced new...experiences.  But underneath it all I still crave the feeling of building something from scratch, marketing it, selling it, and ultimately evaluating if it is going to work, or not.  A good end result is always desired, but the whole process in itself is quite rewarding as well.

So that brings me here, giving myself a platform to track how I go along the way.  To document what I am working on, my thoughts, issues, status and results.  I hope if you read this you enjoy reading about my latest journey.
